			"Q2" : "Is it necessary to install the browser plug-in on my computer?",
			"R2" : "It isn't necessary, but it is really helpful. Once the browser plug-in is installed, PasswordBox automatically saves your login information while you're browsing, saving you the trouble of entering this into your PasswordBox manually. Once in your PasswordBox, your usernames and passwords for a particular site will be auto-filled for you. You'll be logged in to the site without ever having to touch your keyboard. ",
			"Q3" : "How can I change my Master Password?",
			"R3" : "1. Tap on settings on the menu and tap on Change master password. 2. You can change your Master Password by typing a new one in the 'Master Password' field. 3. You'll also need to type your current Master Password to confirm the changes to your account.",
			"Q4" : "I've lost my Master Password, how can I get back into my account?",
			"R4" : "If you forget your Master Password there is no way to retrieve it. PasswordBox is comparable to a safety deposit box: if you lose the key to your deposit box, you can't ask the bank for a duplicate key to open the safe. This way you have peace of mind because you know you are the only person who can decrypt the data.",
			"Q5" : "How secure is PasswordBox?",
			"R5" : "All your sensitive data is encrypted and decrypted on your iPhone by a Master Password that only you know. This Master Password is NOT stored on a PasswordBox server and this is why we can guarantee your security.",
			"Q6" : "How is my data encrypted and decrypted?",
			"R6" : "PasswordBox uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and the RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt your data. This type of Advanced Encryption Standard has been adopted by the U.S. government and is now used worldwide. AES is the first publicly accessible and open cipher approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) for top-secret information.",

			"Q8" : "Is my Master Password saved on the PasswordBox server?",
			"R8" : "Absolutely not! PasswordBox does not store your Master Password on any server. Your Master Password is what allows you to unlock decrypted data (for viewing) and to encrypt data (for syncing). Only your encrypted data is synced on PasswordBox servers and cannot be decrypted without your Master Password.",
			"Q9" : "Can an employee from PasswordBox gain access to my information?",
			"R9" : "No employee of PasswordBox can ever access your secure information. Your data is encrypted on your iPhone before it is sent to PasswordBox servers and can only be decrypted on your iPhone with your Master Password. PasswordBox never sees or stores your Master Password, so can never gain access to your data.",

			"Q12" : "Does my data automatically sync?",
			"R12" : "Yes. Because PasswordBox is cloud-based, once you've added or changed a password on any device, that data is synced automatically in the PasswordBox system - after being encrypted by your device, of course. You've changed a password on your mobile tablet and want immediate access to it on your desktop computer? It's already there and ready to be used. This is particularly helpful if you use multiple browsers, as you can switch between them while always having access to your current login information.",

			"Q2" : "Why log in/sign in to PasswordBox?",
			"A2": "PasswordBox doesn't just store your encrypted passwords, it also makes web browsing an easier, more seamless experience.

			"Q3": "What do I do if I have multiple usernames and passwords for the same site?",
			"A3": "When the PasswordBox browser plug-in detects a site that you have multiple usernames for, you will be offered a choice of usernames to log in with. Simply click on the username of the account you would like to access the website with and PasswordBox will log you in to that account automatically.",
			"Q4" : "Can I  edit/change my saved passwords?",
			"A4" : "Yes! On every password asset there is a small pencil shaped icon or gear shaped icon (depending on your layout) on the right hand side. By clicking any of the information on the password detail page, you can edit and save accordingly.",
			"Q5": "PasswordBox isn't saving my login information for a website, what can I do?",
			"A5": "If PasswordBox isn't automatically recognizing a login site then you can enter in the login information manually. To do this, click on ADD New. Enter the information requested into each of the fields and click save to store the login in your PasswordBox.",
			"Q6": "Can several people use PasswordBox on a shared computer?",
			"A6": "Yes - in fact, it's a much safer, easier way to manage login information when you're sharing a computer. Each user signs into their PasswordBox using their unique username and Master Password and gains instant access to their secure data.",
			"Q7": "How much does it cost?",
			"A7": "PasswordBox is similar to Dropbox. Users can store up to 25 passwords and sync across all devices for free before being prompted to upgrade to a premium account. A premium account has more password storage for $1 per month, billed annually. You can earn a premium membership with more password storage by referring friends to PasswordBox. Once five referrals have been accepted, you will automatically receive a premium membership.",

			"Q10": "My antivirus program or browser has warned me that PasswordBox is a virus/trojan/suspicious - should I be concerned?",
			"A10": "Antivirus programs rely on large networks of users to verify that a website is safe. This warning usually occurs because PasswordBox has released a new software update that hasn't been distributed to enough users to verify its authenticity. We can assure you that there is no risk. However, if you are still concerned, we invite you to visit passwordbox.com and click on the McAfee secure icon to view an up-to-date security report.",
			"Q11": "How can I change the email address connected with my PasswordBox account?",
			"A11": "Currently, PasswordBox will not allow you to change the email address associated with your account.",
			"Q12": "How long does it take for a shared item to appear in the other user's PasswordBox?",
			"A12": "Your PasswordBox is synced every 60 seconds, so it's normal if the person you shared something with doesn't see the shared password in their PasswordBox immediately after you've shared it.",
			"Q13": "How secure is PasswordBox?",
			"A13": "All your sensitive data is encrypted and decrypted in AES-256 on your device by a Master Password that only you know. This Master Password is NEVER stored on PasswordBox servers and this is how we can guarantee your security.",

			"Q15": "When I share a password, how is my data encrypted and decrypted?",

Only you and the person you've shared your info with can encrypt and decrypt the info. The tech-savvy answer is that when you create your PasswordBox account, a 2048 bits RSA Public-Private key pair is generated using openSSL. When you share a password, a shared secret will be encrypted with the public key of the person you're sharing with and exchanged with that person. Only after this is done can the person you've shared with be able to decrypt your shared password on their device. Watch our video to learn more.",

			"Q21": "If I use the Legacy Locker feature, how do the people I trust access my data after I pass away?",
			"A21": "PasswordBox is the only password manager that you can trust during your life and after. You choose who will take care of your different online accounts, so you'll have peace of mind knowing that your digital assets will be managed according to your wishes. Legacy Locker passwords are ONLY shared in the event of an account holder's passing.<br><br>First, invite a person you trust to manage your accounts in your absence.

When you encrypt your passwords, your computer also encrypts your passwords with a second bank-grade encryption key for the person you trust. Once we have verified a passing, we trigger the transfer of this encrypted file to the PasswordBox of the trusted person so they can decrypt and access the Legacy Locker passwords.",
			"Q22": "Is this a legal service?",
			"A22": "No. PasswordBox is not a legal service and does not provide legal advice or that of estate planning. This service is designed to complement the existing estate plan you already have in place and deals specifically with your Internet passwords.",

			"Q24": "Can't I just write down all my passwords and keep them in a safe deposit box?",
			"A24": "Of course you can, but maintaining a physical list in today's fast-paced environment is cumbersome and lacks security or privacy. This solution simply isn't practical nor does it cater to our ever-changing digital lifestyles.",

			"Q27": "I installed PasswordBox on all my browsers, but it's not running in Chrome. What should I do?",
			"A27": "1) Look for the green puzzle icon on the Chrome settings menu on the far right of your browser.<br>2) Click to open the menu.<br>3) Click on New extension added (PasswordBox) at the bottom of the menu which will open a dialog box.<br>4) Click Enable extension and PasswordBox will start running.",
			"Q28": "I'm keeping passwords in another password manager, can I transfer them to PasswordBox?",
			"A28": "Yes! It's easy to import your sensitive data with our password importer.
