	"faq": {
		"title": "FAQs",

		"Q1": "What is True Key™?",
		"A1": "True Key™ by Intel Security is changing the way the world logs in.  True Key removes the hassle of remembering multiple passwords and instantly logs you in to your apps, sites and devices using factors that are unique to you, like your facial features and identifiers for the devices you own.  And, the more factors you use, the stronger your True Key becomes, making it even easier to confirm it's really you. With True Key, you are the password.  You will have  more control over your digital identity and will be able to roam your digital world in a faster, easier, and safer way.",

		"Q2": "How does it work?",
		"A2": "Open your True Key account on a smartphone, tablet, or PC and create your profile so True Key knows it's you. Websites that support True Key will know it's you automatically so you won't need to type in - or even remember - a password. Websites that are not yet supported by True Key use the included password manager to learn and automatically enter your usernames and passwords for you. With True Key, you are the password.  You will have  more control over your digital identity and be able to roam your digital world in a faster, easier, and safer way.",

		"Q3": "Why log in/sign in with True Key?",
		"A3": "True Key simplifies your life, and lets the digital world know it's really you. By logging in once to True Key using unique attributes like your facial math, or your fingerprint you can instantly get where you want to go.",

		"Q4": "Can several people use their True Key account on a shared computer?",
		"A4": "Yes, True Key will recognize it's you and only log you in to your own account(s). It's as easy as logging out and back in.",

		"Q6": "How is my data encrypted and decrypted?",
		"A6": "True Key keeps your data locally on your device using AES-256 encryption, one of the strongest grades of encryption available.  Your sensitive data never leaves your device unless encrypted first and only you (and those you authorize) have access to it.",

		"Q7": "Can a True Key employee gain access to data stored in my account or other sensitive information?",
		"A7": "No, with True Key, you are the password.  Your data is encrypted and decrypted on your device and in your control at all times. True Key uses factors that are unique to you - including your facial math, fingerprint or Master Password to encrypt and decrypt only when you need it.",

		"Q10": "Can I use True Key Face Unlock for Windows devices?",
		"A10": "True Key Face Unlock for Windows devices will be coming in early 2015.",

		"Q11": "Do I need a particular web camera?",
		"A11": "True Key will work with your device's front-facing camera and USB-connected cameras.",

		"Q12": "Can someone log in using a picture of me?",
		"A12": "No, True Key has been developed with sophisticated anti-spoofing technology to prevent this kind of log in attempt. You're in good hands with Intel Security.",

		"Q13": "How are you sure it's me logging in?",
		"A13": "You're in good hands with Intel Security. True Key uses very sophisticated algorithms to confirm it's you, including biometrics, facial image, fingerprint, and other attributes that you set up and are unique to you.",

		"Q14": "Where can I use True Key Face Unlock and on which platforms?",
		"A14": "You can download True Key on all popular devices however, facial log in is currently only available on Windows 8, 8.1, Internet Explorer 10 + 11 and Google Chrome browser.  We will be releasing more platforms and ways to authenticate in the months to come."

These items will all be encrypted on your device, and can sync to your other devices after the encrypted information is sent to the secure True Key servers to communicate with you.</p>",
